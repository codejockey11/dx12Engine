TGA specs, from the 2D graphics format web collection.
This was annotated with a remark that there are a few
inaccuracies in this ASCII version.          - b.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file has been created to satisfy numerous requests for information
on Targa image file formats.  The information has been taken from
Appendix C of the Truevision Technical Guide.  Requests for further
information could be directed to:

		   AT&T
		   Electronic Photography and Imaging Center
		   2002 Wellesley Ave.
		   Indianapolis, IN 42619

This document does not pretend to be complete, but it does pretend to
be accurate.  If you discover any finger checks or erroneous information
please let me know, ( David McDuffee, 75530,2626), and I will upload the
corrections.  Thanks.

The lack of completeness is due to the fact that the Targa recognizes
over half a dozen image file formats, some of which are more widely
used than others.  I have chosen to re-key the details on only those
formats which I actually use.  Again, if you want to know more about
formats not covered here, you could contact your Truevision representative.

All Targa formats are identified by a Data Type field, which is a one
byte binary integer located in byte three of the file.  The various
file types specified by this field are as follows:

	   0  -  No image data included.
	   1  -  Uncompressed, color-mapped images.
	   2  -  Uncompressed, RGB images.
	   3  -  Uncompressed, black and white images.
	   9  -  Runlength encoded color-mapped images.
	  10  -  Runlength encoded RGB images.
	  11  -  Compressed, black and white images.
	  32  -  Compressed color-mapped data, using Huffman, Delta, and
					runlength encoding.
	  33  -  Compressed color-mapped data, using Huffman, Delta, and
					runlength encoding.  4-pass quadtree-type process.

This document will describe only four formats: 1, 2, 9, and 10.

|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |
